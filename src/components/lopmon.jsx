      <p>
        Lopmon is an Animal Digimon. It is an extremely precious Rookie Digimon
        that is a twin to Terriermon. While Terriermon has only one horn growing
        from its head and has a calm but robust personality, Lopmon has three
        horns growing from its head and has the personality of a lonely crybaby.
        The way it grows is shrouded in mystery and though it can be classified
        as a Beast-species Digimon from its body structure, aside from that, it
        is still not understood. Neither of them seem like "Combat Species"
        Digimon, but when battling, they show that they are more powerful than
        they appear.
