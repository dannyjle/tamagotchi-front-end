      <h2>Gatomon</h2>

      <p>
        Patamon is a Mammal Digimon. It is characterized by its large ears, and
        is able to fly through the air by using them as large wings, but because
        it only goes at a speed of 1 kph, it is said that it is definitely
        faster walking. However, it's very popular because its appearance is
        cute when it is desperately flying (though it seems that it doesn't feel
        the same). Due to its extremely obedient personality, its trainers are
        well-defended. Also, even though Patamon doesn't wear a Holy Ring, it is
        able to exhibit its hidden holy power, and it appears to have inherited
        the genes of ancient Digimon.
